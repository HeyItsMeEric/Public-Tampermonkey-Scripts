# Tampermonkey-scripts
Helpful scripts for increasing productivity and ad-blocking. [Tampermonkey](<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon>) is a userscript manager that has the ability to change the "layout of a page, add or remove new functionality and content, or automate actions."

#Youtube Recommended Content Blocker
Youtube is a very useful site for learning and taking it back a notch. When you load up youtube.com, you are met with a panel of videos that are recommended by the Youtube algorithm; anytime I want to search for a video on Youtube the homepage always catches my attention with some video that I don't need to watch

That's why I created a userscript using Tampermonkey to get rid of these recommended videos.
